Questions asked for the internship

Q1.
I am searching for a "Car Cover" on OLX - using "www.olx.in/items/q-car-cover". Write a python program that gives me the search results in a file.
[Code](https://github.com/c0dem0de/AffinityAnswers/blob/main/olx-ads.py)

Usage:
1. Setup virtual environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
```
2. Install dependencies
```sh
pip install httpx selectolax
```
3. Run script
```sh
python olx-ads.py
```

Q2.
Write a shell script to extract 'Scheme Name' and 'Asset Value' from "https://www.amfiindia.com/spaqes/NAVAll.txt" and save as TSV.
[Code](https://github.com/c0dem0de/AffinityAnswers/blob/main/scheme-NAV.sh)

Should this data be in JSON instead?
> Given the data is in CSV, and then converted to TSV these formats are best suited if to be opened and viewed easily in softwares like Excel. Had the data have more nested structures, nodes and relations to different tables, using a json format would be a better choice for better visualisation and hierarchical representation.
